# Dictionary_Learning_Project
This repository provides an example of dictionary learning using gradient descent and other optimization algorithms to update both the dictionary and sparse matrix. The methods implemented in this repository aim to achieve fast processing speeds and high reconstruction accuracy.
# Two features:
Transient Electromagnetic Signals Example: An example focused on transient electromagnetic signals is provided, demonstrating the application of dictionary learning in signal processing.
Image Dictionary Learning Pipeline: Includes a data preprocessing pipeline for image dictionary learning.
